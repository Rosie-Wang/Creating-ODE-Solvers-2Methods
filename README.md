# Creating-ODE-solvers-2Methods
This was a lab (3) I coded from scratch for a second year ordinary differential equations course. It consists of 2 separate function files (IEM.m and Aeuler.m), which I've written to solve ODEs using the Improved Euler's method and Adaptive Euler's method, respectively. The lab3_wangrush file contain exercises I've written that plot and compare solutions to ODEs under each method.
